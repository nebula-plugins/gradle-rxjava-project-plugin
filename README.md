This plugin is to support projects in the ReactiveX org (and it isn't meant to be used elsewhere). It is at its essence
just a combination of other plugins that are common to all ReactiveX projects, with some additional configuration. The 
primary responsibilities to:

  * Provide release process
  * Configure publishing
  * Recommend license headers
  * Create a performance module for testing with jmh
  * Configure modules to be as OSGI modules
  * Set defaults for javadoc formatting
  
This project could be used as an example of how a "project plugin" could work. A "project plugin" is a Gradle that 
provides consistency across many projects, e.g. in a Github org or an enterprise.

# Plugins Used

For reference, these are Gradle-related modules used:

  * com.netflix.nebula:nebula-project-plugin
  * com.netflix.nebula:nebula-bintray-plugin' wraps gradle-bintray-plugin with different defaults and adding OJO support and multi-module support.
  * com.netflix.nebula:nebula-publishing-plugin for producing a jar, source jar, javadoc jar with metadata about how it was produced.
  * com.github.jengelman.gradle.plugins:shadow for generating a binary for the performances tests to run from.
  * nl.javadude.gradle.plugins:license-gradle-plugin for license recommendations
  * org.ajoberstar:gradle-git:1.3.0 for release process.

    plugins {

      apply plugin: 'nebula.rxjava-project'
    }

or if older than gradle 2.1

    buildscript {
      repositories { jcenter() }
      dependencies { classpath 'com.netflix.nebula:gradle-rxjava-project-plugin:3.+' }
    }

    allprojects {
        apply plugin: 'nebula.rxjava-project'
    }

    }
