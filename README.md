This plugin is to support projects in the ReactiveX org (and it isn't meant to be used elsewhere). It is at its essence
just a combination of other plugins that are common to all ReactiveX projects, with some additional configuration. The 
primary responsibilities to:

  * Provide release process
  * Configure publishing
  * Recommend license headers
  * Create a performance module for testing with jmh
  * Configure modules to be as OSGI modules
  * Set defaults for javadoc formatting
  
This project could be used as an example of how a "project plugin" could work. A "project plugin" is a Gradle that 
provides consistency across many projects, e.g. in a Github org or an enterprise.
